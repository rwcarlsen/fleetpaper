	abstract = {When is it better to use agent-based ({AB}) models, and when should differential equation ({DE}) models be used? Whereas {DE} models assume homogeneity and perfect mixing within compartments, {AB} models can capture heterogeneity across individuals and in the network of interactions among them. {AB} models relax aggregation assumptions, but entail computational and cognitive costs that may limit sensitivity analysis and model scope. Because resources are limited, the costs and benefits of such disaggregation should guide the choice of models for policy analysis. Using contagious disease as an example, we contrast the dynamics of a stochastic {AB} model with those of the analogous deterministic compartment {DE} model. We examine the impact of individual heterogeneity and different network topologies, including fully connected, random, Watts-Strogatz small world, scale-free, and lattice networks. Obviously, deterministic models yield a single trajectory for each parameter set, while stochastic models yield a distribution of outcomes. More interestingly, the {DE} and mean {AB} dynamics differ for several metrics relevant to public health, including diffusion speed, peak load on health services infrastructure, and total disease burden. The response of the models to policies can also differ even when their base case behavior is similar. In some conditions, however, these differences in means are small compared to variability caused by stochastic events, parameter uncertainty, and model boundary. We discuss implications for the choice among model types, focusing on policy design. The results apply beyond epidemiology: from innovation adoption to financial panics, many important social phenomena involve analogous processes of diffusion and social contagion.},

A nuclear fuel cycle study could give convincing answers to many questions in regard to technical aspects. However, one nuclear fuel cycle option cannot be superior in all aspects. Therefore a nation must identify its top priority and accordingly evaluate all the possible nuclear fuel cycle options. For such a purpose, this paper examined four different fuel cycle options that are likely to be plausible under situation of Republic of Korea: once-through cycle, {DUPIC} recycling, thermal recycling using {MOX} fuel in {PWR} (pressurized water reactor), and {SFR} (sodium cooled fast reactor) employing fuel recycling by a pyroprocess. The options have been quantitatively compared in terms of resource utilization and waste generation based on 1 {TWh} electricity production at a "steady-state" condition as a basic analysis. This investigation covered from the front-end of the fuel cycles to the final disposal and showed that the Pyro-{SFR} recycling appears to be the most competitive from these material quantitative aspects due to the reduction of the required uranium resources and the least amount of waste generation.

	title = {Comparing Nuclear Fuel Cycle Options},
	abstract = {The comparison of different nuclear fuel cycle options has become an integral element to any analysis of the future prospects for nuclear energy, in the United States and around the world. Concerns for supply security and price volatility of fossil fuels, combined with growing resolve to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases, have caused a general shift in attitudes towards nuclear energy. However, there are lingering sustainability concerns for nuclear energy – long term uranium supply and environmental impact – as well as concerns about the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

Advanced fuel cycles are often considered as a means to address these concerns. Although they can take on many forms, they generally involve the chemical separation of spent nuclear fuel into various constituents, some of which can be recycled into other nuclear reactors and the remainder destined for long term storage or disposal. Like recycling of any commodity, this is designed to reduce the consumption of primary resources, namely uranium, and reduce the quantity (mass, volume or both) and hazard of material destined for disposal in the biosphere. As such, different combinations of technologies are often combined to achieve some combination of these aims. However, as is also true of other commodities, the ability of a given strategy to achieve these aims is not always clear and choosing between different options becomes a matter of policy.},

In addition, the code can provide flexibility for fuel cycle scenarios options (e.g., more reactors and fuel types as well as multi-regional simulations) and its modular design allows for calling other process models or physics codes as needed. In general, the use of Java as the development programming language allows developers to add many more options to the code than with classical systems dynamics environments. Future code implementations include following materials flow at the isotopic level and allowing for its decay at key areas of the fuel cycle. Agent representations will be expanded to provide the option for detailed tracking at the level of single structure (e.g., tracking single reactor of specific type rather than tracking of a group of reactors of specific type if needed). The autonomy of certain types of agents (e.g. reprocessing facilities) will be expanded providing it with rules that allow it to function as independent agent that can modify its characteristics as needed. This capability can be a key feature for the purpose of performing certain optimization schemes that can be called for by the code user.},

The program would be imple mented using an interconnected architecture of d codes ranging from the fuel cycle analysis code, which is the subject of the review, to fundamental physical and mechanistic codes. Four main functions are defined for the code. Function 1 is the ability to characterize and deploy individual fuel cycle facilities and reactors in a simulation while discretely tracking material move ments. Function 2 is the capability to perform an uncer tainty analysis for each element of the fuel cycle and an aggregate uncertainty analysis. Function 3 is the inclu sion of an optimization engine able to optimize simulta neously across multiple objective functions. Function 4 is open and accessible code software and documentation to aid in collaboration between multiple entities and to facilitate software updates. Existing codes, categorized as annualized or dis crete fuel tracking codes, were assessed according to the fourfunctions and associated requirements. These codes were developed by various government, education, and industrial entities to fulfill particular needs. In some cases, decisions were made during code development to limit the level of detail included in a code to ease its use or to focus on certain aspects of a fuel cycle to address specific questions. The review revealed that while no two of the codes are identical, they all perform many of the same basic functions. No code was able to perform defined function 2 or several requirements of functions 1 and 3. Based on this review, it was concluded that the functions and requirements will be met only with development of a new code, referred to as {GENIUS}.},

The model can describe various fuel cycle configurations (ranging from once-through to multiple recycling) and reactor types with several regions and-batches. It can also be used as a submodel in a regional or global fuel cycle system. Recursive equations for the fuel composition at each point of the cycle were obtained. For specific simplified cases, nonrecursive and equilibrium equations were also derived for compositions, with which the waste reduction ratio was formulated as a function of the system parameters, to show usage of this model for theoretical understanding of the relationship between parameters and performances of the system. A numerical code for this mathematical model was developed. For a simplified equilibrium cycle, sensitivity and constrained optimization of the toxicity reduction ratio with respect to the system parameters were investigated by using the present model and code. It appears that the most important parameter to minimize waste toxicity is the separation efficiency at reprocessing. High fuel enrichment is beneficial because it expands the parametric space within the constraints. Also, depending on the constraints that apply, either the irradiation time or the fraction of core reprocessed at each cycle will be the second most important parameter.},

The debate as to which is the most appropriate technology continues, with each fuel system and reactor type delivering specific advantages and disadvantages which can be difficult to compare fairly. This paper demonstrates a framework of performance metrics which, coupled with a first-order lumped reactor model to determine nuclide population balances, can be used to quantify the aforementioned pros and cons for a range of different fuel and reactor combinations.

This paper presents and analyzes a framework for generating a sequence of approximations to the objective function and managing the use of these approximations as surrogates for optimization. The result is to obtain convergence to a minimizer of an expensive objective function subject to simple constraints. The approach is widely applicable because it does not require, or even explicitly approximate, derivatives of the objective. Numerical results are presented for a 31-variable helicopter rotor blade design example and for a standard optimization test example.},

	issn = {0029-5450},
	abstract = {Technology development and deployment decisions are justified by weighing their costs against the expected benefits. Multiple nuclear fuel cycle ({NFC}) simulation models have been devised, some with the aim of quantifying cyclewide sensitivities to variations from base-case scenarios. Base-case sensitivity studies often perturb only one parameter at a time and only in the region around the initial value. This paper details a sensitivity study methodology that applies entropy-based statistical methods of information theory to describe outcomes produced by an {NFC} model. This supersedes past efforts at sensitivity and uncertainty analysis by allowing a much larger space to be explored. Here, 30 independent fuel cycle parameters for a fast reactor light water reactor hybrid scenario are varied simultaneously and stochastically. This fuel cycle schema was chosen as a well-known, sufficiently complex model; the underlying statistical methods could be applied to any cycle. This study uses the uncertainty coefficient computed from contingency tables ({CTs}) to represent the sensitivity of a technology-defining input to the response. The response of interest here was taken to be the deep geologic repository capacity for a given realization of fuel cycle inputs. After computing the uncertainty coefficients, the inputs themselves are sorted based on decreasing sensitivities. Fast reactor used fuel plutonium separations were found to be most important to the cycle. Furthermore, to represent input covariances (the effect of one input on the sensitivity of a second input to the response), a new measure is defined on three-dimensional {CTs}. This metric is the coefficient of the variation of uncertainty coefficient of two-dimensional slices of the original table. Sorting by this sensitivity of sensitivity metric, the input pair of fast reactor americium separations together with high-level-waste storage time was found to have the largest joint effect on the repository capacity.},

The underlying algorithm used is a pattern search method, or more specifically, a coordinate search method, which guarantees convergence to stationary points from arbitrary starting points. In the (optional) search step of coordinate search, the algorithm incorporates a particle swarm scheme for dissemination of points in the feasible region, equipping the overall method with the capability of finding a global minimizer. Our extensive numerical experiments showed that the resulting algorithm is highly competitive with other global optimization methods based only on function values. {PSwarm} is extended in this paper to handle general linear constraints. The poll step now incorporates positive generators for the tangent cone of the approximated active constraints, including a provision for the degenerate case. The search step has also been adapted accordingly. In particular, the initial population for particle swarm used in the search step is computed by first inscribing an ellipsoid of maximum volume to the feasible set. We have again compared {PSwarm} with other solvers (including some designed for global optimization) and the results confirm its competitiveness in terms of efficiency and robustness.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the solution of bound-constrained optimization problems using algorithms that require only the availability of objective function values but no derivative information. We refer to these algorithms as derivative-free algorithms. Fueled by a growing number of applications in science and engineering, the development of derivative-free optimization algorithms has long been studied, and it has found renewed interest in recent time. Along with many derivative-free algorithms, many software implementations have also appeared. The paper presents a review of derivative-free algorithms, followed by a systematic comparison of 22 related implementations using a test set of 502 problems. The test bed includes convex and nonconvex problems, smooth as well as nonsmooth problems. The algorithms were tested under the same conditions and ranked under several criteria, including their ability to find near-global solutions for nonconvex problems, improve a given starting point, and refine a near-optimal solution. A total of 112,448 problem instances were solved. We find that the ability of all these solvers to obtain good solutions diminishes with increasing problem size. For the problems used in this study, {TOMLAB}/{MULTIMIN}, {TOMLAB}/{GLCCLUSTER}, {MCS} and {TOMLAB}/{LGO} are better, on average, than other derivative-free solvers in terms of solution quality within 2,500 function evaluations. These global solvers outperform local solvers even for convex problems. Finally, {TOMLAB}/{OQNLP}, {NEWUOA}, and {TOMLAB}/{MULTIMIN} show superior performance in terms of refining a near-optimal solution.},

For continuously differentiable functions we also derive a bound relating a measure of stationarity, which is equivalent to the norm of the gradient of the objective in the unconstrained case, and a parameter used by {GSS} algorithms to control the lengths of the steps. With the additional assumption that the derivative is Lipschitz, we obtain a big-O bound. As a consequence of this relationship, we obtain subsequence convergence to a {KKT} point, even though {GSS} algorithms lack explicit gradient information.

	abstract = {A compact, efficient method for recycling {IFR} fuel is being developed. This method, known as pyroprocessing, capitalizes on the use of metal fuel in the {IFR} and provides separation of actinide elements from fission products by means of an electrorefining step. The process of electrorefining is based on well-understood electrochemical concepts, the applications of which are described in this chapter. With only the addition of head-end processing steps, the pyroprocess can be applied with equal success to fuel types other than metal, enabling a symbiotic system wherein the {IFR} can be used to fission the actinide elements in spent nuclear fuel from other types of reactor.},
